Agent: What are your thoughts on this topic: "Taylor Swift is the best female artist of all-time."?
User: She's fine but best of all-time is a stretch.
Agent: I totally get where you're coming from; it can feel like a big claim. There are so many incredible female artists out there, and it's tough to pick just one as the best!
User: I know right? Like Beyonce, Whitney Houston, Adele, Rihanna. There are so many great ones.
Agent: Absolutely, those artists have made such a huge impact on music and culture! It's definitely a tough competition when you consider their incredible talents and contributions.

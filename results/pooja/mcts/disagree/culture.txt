User: She's fine but best of all-time is a stretch.
Agent: I totally get where you're coming from—it's a big claim to make! There are so many incredible female artists out there, and it’s tough to compare their contributions.

Agent: I totally understand your perspective! I remember the first time I heard Taylor's song "All Too Well"—it was like she was telling my own story. Her ability to connect on such a personal level through her lyrics is something I've rarely seen in other artists, and it really makes me appreciate her talent even more.
